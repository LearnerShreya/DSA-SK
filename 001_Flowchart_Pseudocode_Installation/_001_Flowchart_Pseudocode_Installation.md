# Flowchart Pseudocode Installation

---

## Why Learn This?

Before writing any code, it's essential to first **plan and structure** solution. This is where **flowcharts** and **pseudocode** help:

* **Flowcharts** help you visualize the logic step-by-step.
* **Pseudocode** lets you write logic in plain language before converting it into real code.

They help build logical thinking and avoid syntax errors in the early phase.

## What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a **diagrammatic representation** of an algorithm. It shows the sequence of operations using specific symbols.

### Purpose:

* Helps visualize program logic.
* Makes it easier to debug or explain a program.
* Acts as a blueprint before starting actual code.

## Common Flowchart Symbols

| Symbol           | Shape         | Description                                                                                      | Used For (Type of Step)                 | Example(s)                              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Terminator**   | Oval          | Represents the **start or end** of a flow.                                                       | Program entry/exit                      | `Start`, `End`                          |
| **Input/Output** | Parallelogram | Used to **take input** from the user or **display output**.                                      | Input, Output                           | `Input A`, `Print Sum`                  |
| **Process**      | Rectangle     | Represents **internal operations** like **initialization**, **assignment**, or **calculations**. | Initialization, Assignment, Calculation | `name = "Tony"`, `i = 0`, `sum = A + B` |
| **Decision**     | Diamond       | Represents a **condition check** with Yes/No or True/False outcome.                              | If-Else, Loop condition, Comparisons    | `If A > B`, `Is Even?`                  |
| **Flowline**     | Arrow         | Shows the **direction of control** or logical flow between steps.                                | Connecting steps in order               | Arrows between shapes                   |

## Example Flowchart

**Problem**: Add two numbers and print the sum.

```
   [Start]
      |
[Input A, B]
      |
[Sum = A + B]
      |
[Print Sum]
      |
   [End]
```

## What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is a simplified way to describe the steps of a program in **plain English** or **structured format**. It is not written in any specific programming language, but it helps lay out the logic clearly.

### Purpose:

* Helps focus on the logic without worrying about syntax.
* Easier to write, read, and understand.
* Can be easily converted to any programming language.

---

## Pseudocode Guidelines

* Write steps in logical order.
* Use common keywords: `START`, `READ`, `PRINT`, `IF`, `WHILE`, `END`, etc.
* Indent steps inside conditions or loops.
* Avoid using language-specific syntax (e.g., no semicolons or curly braces).

---

## Pseudocode Example

**Problem**: Add two numbers and display the result.

```
START
   READ A
   READ B
   SUM ‚Üê A + B
   PRINT SUM
END
```

## How Code Runs? (Behind the Scenes)


Absolutely! Here's the clean and minimal version exactly as you asked:

````markdown
### üîÑ Compilation Flow

`code.cpp` (Source Code) ‚ûù **Compiler** ‚ûù `a.exe` (Executable File by default on Windows) or `a.out` (on Linux/Mac)

# To Compile the Code
g++ code.cpp
Or
g++ code.cpp -o code.exe
````

- g++ ‚Üí The GNU C++ compiler
- code.cpp ‚Üí Your source file
- No `-o` means the output file will be named `a.exe` (Windows) or `a.out` (Linux/Mac) by default


**To Run the Executable:**

```bash
a.exe       # on Windows
./a.out     # on Linux/Mac
```


Whether you're writing in **Python**, **C++**, or any other language ‚Äî here's what happens:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **You write source code** in a file (e.g., `main.cpp` or `main.py`)
2. **Translation** happens:

   * **C++ uses a Compiler**: Converts entire code to machine code before running
   * **Python uses an Interpreter**: Executes code line-by-line
3. **Memory Allocation**:

   * Variables are stored in **RAM**
   * Data types define how much space they take
4. **Execution Flow**:

   * Starts from `main()` or top of the script
   * Moves **line-by-line**, making decisions at conditionals or loops
   * Executes **functions**, **loops**, and **logic** blocks
5. **Input/Output**:

   * Input is taken from user or system
   * Output is printed to screen or written to file
6. **Termination**:

   * Program ends when logic completes or explicitly encounters `return` or `exit`
